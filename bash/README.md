# Hello world in Bash

Bash is a Unix command line interpreter. It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or file. Being the default shell for most Linux distributions, almost all developers should have basic knowledge of Bash.

## Prerequisites

If you are on Windows, you can install Bash by installing the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). If you are on Linux, Bash is already installed.

## How to run

1. Run `bash hello.sh` to run the program.
