# Hello world in CoffeeScript

CoffeeScript is a high-level general-purpose multi-paradigm programming language that transpiles to JavaScript. By adding syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby and Python, CoffeeScript is designed to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability.

The popularity of CoffeeScript has declined over the years as more languages have been released that compile to JavaScript, such as Microsoft's TypeScript. However, CoffeeScript is still used in many projects, especially those that use the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) framework.
