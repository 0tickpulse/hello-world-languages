# Hello world in DenizenScript

DenizenScript is a high-level scripting language developed by the DenizenScript team (led by McMonkey) that is used for scripting in Minecraft. Many developers prefer DenizenScript to Java due to its simplicity, ease of use, improved readability, better debugging, and more. It has a lot of bridges to other Minecraft plugins including Citizens, MythicMobs, Essentials, and more.

## Prerequisites

- A Minecraft server running SpigotMC or PaperMC
- [Denizen](https://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/Denizen/): The plugin that allows you to script in Minecraft.

## How to run

1. Start the Minecraft server, or run `/ex reload`.
2. Run `/ex run hello_world`.
