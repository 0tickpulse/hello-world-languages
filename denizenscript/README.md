# Hello world in DenizenScript

DenizenScript is a high-level scripting language developed by the DenizenScript team (led by mcmonkey) that is used for scripting in Minecraft. Many developers prefer DenizenScript to Java due to its simplicity, ease of use, improved readability, better debugging, and more. It has a lot of bridges to other Minecraft plugins including Citizens, MythicMobs, Essentials, and more.

DenizenScript has many differences when compared to many other languages. Mainly using a command-argument syntax, DenizenScript almost resembles a command-line interface. This allows for high simplicity and readability.
