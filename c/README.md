# Hello world in C

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting concepts such as structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.

C is a highly influential language: It is used in many projects such as the Linux kernel. Its syntax inspired the syntax of many other languages, such as C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript, so much so that they are often referred to as "C-syntax" languages.

However, the popularity of C has slowly declined over the years as users choose other languages such as C++, Java, and Python. Part of this is because C requires a lot of manual work for basic tasks.

## Prerequisites

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/): The GNU Compiler Collection, a compiler for C, C++, and other languages.

## How to run

1. Run `gcc hello.c -o hello` to compile the program.
2. Run `hello` to run the program.
