# Hello world in as many languages as possible

This repository contains a collection of "Hello World" programs in as many languages as possible. The goal is to have a single repository that contains a "Hello World" program in as many languages as possible. This is a work in progress, and contributions are welcome.

## Why?

I wanted the opportunity to research different languages and create a project in each language. I also wanted to create a space for people to discover new languages and see a simple example of how to create a project in them.

## How to contribute

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add a "Hello World" program in a new language. It should be in a directory named after the language, and the program should log **the exact string** `Hello, World!` to the console. Make sure to include a `README.md` file following this template:

```md
# Hello world in [language]

[Describe the language]
