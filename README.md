# Hello world in as many languages as possible

This repository contains a collection of "Hello World" programs in as many languages as possible. The goal is to have a single repository that contains a "Hello World" program in as many languages as possible. This is a work in progress, and contributions are welcome.

## Why?

I wanted the opportunity to research different languages and create a project in each language. I also wanted to create a space for people to discover new languages and see a simple example of how to create a project in them.

## How to contribute

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add a "Hello World" program in a new language. It should be in a directory named after the language, and the program should log **the exact string** `Hello, World!` to the console. Make sure to include a `README.md` file following this template:

```md
# Hello world in [language]

[Describe the language]

## Prerequisites

- [Dependency 1](link to dependency 1): [Description of dependency 1]
- [Dependency 2](link to dependency 2): [Description of dependency 2]

## How to run

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
```

### Notes

You should not necessarily use the minimum amount of code possible. Instead, use code that accurately reflects real-world usage of the language. Show things like variables and functions.

Use the proper structure for your project. For example, the JavaScript program includes a `package.json` file and a `src` directory. The Java program includes a `pom.xml` file, a `src` directory, and a `target` directory. The Python program includes a `requirements.txt` file and a `src` directory.

Use best practices. The Python program includes an `if __name__ == "__main__"` statement. Again, this is not necessary, but it is a best practice.

If there's something special about a language, use it in your program. For example, I showed how C does not have a string type by using a `char` array.
