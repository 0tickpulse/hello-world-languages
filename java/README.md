# Hello world in Java

Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It is used to create web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games, and much more.

Java is extremely popular. It is used in many projects such as Minecraft and Android. Many languages were also developed to run on the JVM, such as Kotlin, Scala, and Clojure.

However, Java has a few problems. Compared to other languages, it is relatively slow, has more boilerplate code, and forces OOP on developers. OOP is not always the best solution for every problem and leads to problems such as the [God Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object), excessive shared mutable state, increased complexity due to design patterns, and more.
