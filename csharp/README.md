# Hello world in C#

C# is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. It is used to create web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games, and much more.

It takes a lot of inspiration from Java to the point that it is sometimes called "Microsoft's Java". Many would consider it *better* than Java as it has reduced verbosity.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download): A free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## How to run

1. Run `dotnet run --project ./HelloWorld` to run the program.
