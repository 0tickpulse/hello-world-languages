# Hello world in Rust

Rust is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language that values low-level performance while providing high-level simplicity. Unlike C and C++, Rust is memory-safe and thread-safe. While those languages require manual memory allocation, and higher-level languages use garbage collection, Rust uses something unique known as the borrow checker, a feature of the compiler that tracks the lifetime of objects. This allows Rust to be memory-safe while preventing concurrent data races. While it is popular for systems programming, it also provides a lot of functional programming concepts, such as immutability by default, pattern matching, and higher-order functions. It also provides a package manager called Cargo.

In 2022 it became the third language in the Linux kernel (after C and Assembly).
