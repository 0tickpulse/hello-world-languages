# Hello world in Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, high-level, interpreted, multi-paradigm programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Something interesting about Ruby is that every value is an object, including primitives like integers and booleans. This means that every value has methods, and you can call methods on primitives. For example, you can call `to_s` on an integer to convert it to a string:

```rb
1.to_s # => "1"
```

## Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - The language.

## How to run
